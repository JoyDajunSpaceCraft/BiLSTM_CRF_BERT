a	O

more	O
recent	O

that	O

Here	O
we	O
studied	O
two	O

which	O
might	O

Therefore	O
we	O

that	O

that	O

Both	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
basic	O
disagreements	B
present	O
in	O
the	O
continuing	O
debate	B
about	O
consciousness	B
pertains	O
to	O
its	O
gradational	B
nature	O

The	O
general	O
aim	O
of	O
this	O
article	B
is	O
to	O
show	O
how	O
consciousness	B
might	O
be	O
graded	B
and	O
multidimensional	B
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

We	O
therefore	O
focus	O
on	O
the	O
question	B
of	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
exactly	O
that	O
is	O
or	O
could	O
be	O
graded	B
in	O
cases	B
of	O
consciousness	O
and	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
measure	B
it	O

Ultimately	O
four	O
different	O
gradable	B
aspects	B
of	O
consciousness	B
will	O
be	O
described:	O
quality	O
abstractness	O
complexity	B
and	O
usefulness	O
which	O
belong	O
to	O
four	O
different	O
dimensions	O
these	O
being	O
understood	O
respectively	O
as	O
phenomenal	O
semantic	O
physiological	O
and	O
functional	O

Consequently	O
consciousness	B
may	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
vary	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
phenomenal	B
quality	O
semantic	B
abstraction	O
physiological	B
complexity	O
and	O
functional	B
usefulness	O

It	O
is	O
hoped	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
four-dimensional	O
approach	O
will	O
help	O
to	O
clarify	O
and	O
justify	O
claims	O
about	O
the	O
hierarchical	B
nature	I
of	O
consciousness	O

The	O
approach	B
also	O
proves	O
explanatorily	O
advantageous	O
as	O
it	O
enables	O
us	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
draw	O
attention	B
to	O
certain	O
new	O
and	O
important	B
differences	B
in	O
respect	O
of	O
subjective	B

how	O
a	O

creature	B
may	O
be	O
ranked	B
higher	B
in	O
one	O
dimension	O
of	O
consciousness	B
and	O
lower	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
another	O
